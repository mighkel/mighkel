# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mike

> Facilities BIM Coordinator by day, Volunteer Firefighter by night and sometimes day too.

### 🧰 What I Do
- 🏗️ 30+ years wrangling CAD/BIM models (AutoCAD, Revit, Navisworks, ACC, Imaginit Clarity)
- 🚒 10+ years as a volunteer firefighter — currently the communications officer and amateur IT dude
- 📱 5+ years tinkering with Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) — learning to deploy it in the field
- 🧠 Occasionally write scripts with the help of LLMs (they’re the smart ones, I just ask nicely)
- 📄 Helped others with documentation and pull requests — I know just enough Git to be dangerous

### 🧪 Currently Learning
- GitHub basics: commits, branches, pull requests, and how not to break everything
- How to make my README look cool, but not _too_ cool
- As much as I can about the TAK ecosystem without having to be a full-fledged IT guy
- A bit of ham and commercial radio stuff

### 🧙‍♂️ Fun Fact
I use github for my grocery. Ok, not really, but maybe I should.
